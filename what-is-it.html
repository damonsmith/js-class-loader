			<p>(Java) A Free Software tool for bundling and serving large Javascript codebases with
				automatic dependency detection. It is fast, tested, easy to integrate and does not use the words
				rockstar or ninja, or have a website filled with big gradient icons of robot kittens playing
				banjos. (but then it's not a javascript layout framework so I suppose it wouldn't anyway.)</p>
			
			<p>It can be used as either a dev tool that runs in your IDE and generates a bundle file
				for a website, or integrate it into an enterprise scale webapp, either in the build system or as a
				servlet.
			</p>
			
			<p>Developers working on large javascript codebases will know that if you are doing more than
				just a couple of jquery data-tables, some rollovers and menus, if you are actually building
				a domain model and using object oriented concepts then your javascript codebase can very
				quickly get messy and become hard to manage. Things that work for a rapid prototype
				often turn into a mess when the codebase grows. This tool imposes code conventions that keep your
				code neat, clean and easy to manage no matter how large it gets. 
				It uses these conventions to detect dependencies
				and bundle your code for you, so that you can add, remove and refactor code and files without
				having to do anything to your script tags. It is fast enough even on large codebases that it
				allows you to make a change, reload the browser and see the change.</p>
			
			<p>If your project is a java webapp already then this tool will integrate seamlessly as either a 
				runtime servlet or a build time task. If your project is any other sort of application then
				you can use JS-Class-Loader from your editor and your build to manage your javascript code
				quickly and simply.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Principles</h1>
			
			<p>
				JS-Class-Loader was designed with the following requirements in mind:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Must allow the developer to make a change, reload the browser and see the change in a way that 
				does not take any significant time</b><br />
				even on very large codebases (target: ~3,000 source files, 3MB of source)</li>
				
				<li><b>Must allow the developer to debug at the correct source line</b><br />
				currently this means development mode has individual script tags, in future this may be implemented with
				source maps and/or just breaking out individual modules into script tags.</li>
				
				<li><b>It must work seamlessly from the IDE without requiring any non-java tools or software</b><br />
				e.g: must not require the developer to run V8, NodeJS and Grunt just to bundle the js code.
				This reduces the number of moving parts and points of failure, and allows new developers to get up and 
				developing on your project quicker.</li>

				<li><b>Must integrate with existing project structures</b><br />
				For anything other that the simplest use (bundle all files), JS-Class-Loader <b>does</b> impose structure rules on 
				code in order to do dependency detection. It requires
				the concepts of namespaces and names, and for code to be referenced that way when it is used, but it
				will always be completely configurable about where and how many source trees there are, how you define your
				names, and if you use inheritance then you will always be able to configure JS-Class-Loader to work with it.</li>
				
				<li><b>Must be well documented, have good defaults and excellent error messages</b><br />
				The developer should be able to run the jar and muddle their way along to successfully setting up their project purely
				by reading the help and error messages and then setting the settings. The docs must cover all basic setup
				procedures and provide examples and tutorials, and these must be kept up to date. It must <b>NEVER</b> fail silently
				or provide blank or misleading error messages.</li>
			</ul>

				<a name="rules-of-js-class-loader" class="anchor" href="#rules-of-js-class-loader"><span
					class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rules of JS-Class-Loader
			</h2>

			<ol>
				<li><b>Class names must match file names</b><br />
				Whether it's a class, a static object, a function or anything else, the thing in the file must 
				match the name of the file. This is so that when you reference the thing, JS-Class-Loader knows 
				to include the file.</li>
				
				<li><b>Folder structure must match package structure</b><br />
				This is the tried and tested code convention that Java uses, and allows you to separate your
				code into modules and groupings. You can still have that big messy util file in the root namespace
				if you want but JS-Class-Loader allows and encourages you to use proper code structure in your javascript.
				</li>
				<li><b>File names must not have extra dots in them</b><br />
				JS-Class-Loader uses dots for namespaces and gets confused when a filename has dots in it. This may be 
				fixed in future (by converting them to underscores) but for now, no dots in filenames apart from the .js extension.
				(dashes and underscores in filenames are ok though, we recommend converting dots to underscores)</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<p>Having said that, you can still include 3rd party libraries and modules in your bundle
				that don't conform to this scheme. You just need to explicitly include them in your code
				somewhere, you can't just rely on dependency detection to work out that you need them. There are plenty of
				examples in this site of how to include the most common js frameworks and libraries in your codebase</p>
