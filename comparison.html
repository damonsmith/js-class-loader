			<h1>Dojo / CommonJS / AMD</h1>
			<p>Posts like
			<a href="http://tagneto.blogspot.com.au/2011/04/on-inventing-js-module-formats-and.html">this</a> 
			argue that there should not be any more script loaders, that the problem has been solved. 
			Regardless, JS-Class-Loader exists for more serious developers who want to 
			build object-oriented codebases without having to turn every single little class into a module definition,
			wrap it inside an anonymous function, manually manage it's dependencies and define a function to return an
			instance of it. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Individual classes are not modules and you should not have to define a module definition for each one. 
			JS-Class-Loader will in future support optional AMD wrapping for sections of your codebase - 
			either the whole thing, individual source trees in your project or branches of your namespace, but it
			will always use dependency detection and naming conventions to make coding inside your own codebase
			fast, simple and reliable.
			</p>
			
			<h1>RequireJS</h1>
			<p>RequireJS is a popular tool for doing this sort of thing. This project addresses the same problem as
				RequireJS but in a different way. That problem is described very nicely
				<a href="http://www.requirejs.org/docs/why.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>JS-Class-Loader has a very different approach to RequireJS. JS-Class-Loader forces you to use a set, well
				understood file/class/namespace structure, which means it does not need to understand javascript or read JS 
				config blocks, which means it doesn't need to run a js interpreter with all of the complexity,
				overhead and extreme lack of performance that that entails.
			</p>
			
			<p>RequireJS and similar tools are designed for the web developer who is mainly concerned with including
				well known libraries and plugins into their site. If your app mainly involves JQuery, JQuery plugins,
				a layout framework, validation libraries and your code is a bit of config and a few definitions to lay out
				the page then RequireJS may well solve your problem. This tool was built to support web trading front ends,
				where there are thousands of javascript classes defining domain models and libraries.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Solving the wrong problem</h1>
			
			<p>Most of the tools out there to manage javascript try to solve the problem of installing pre-bundled
				3rd party libraries into a web app. Few if any of them make it simple to build a large codebase of object
				oriented code. However, managing a large codebase in javascript takes a million times more work than
				installing some libraries. Here's how the situation generally works for large javascript development teams:</p>
			
			<div class="pure-g-r">
				<div class="pure-u-1-2"><img src="images/dev-comparison.svg" /></div>
				<div class="pure-u-1-2"><img src="images/dev-comparison-key.svg" /></div>
			</div>
			
			<p><b>A javascript developer does not need a suite of massively complex tooling to help with the trivial 
				task of downloading and installing a 3rd party js library. Developers need a tools that help
				manage complexity in their own codebase and reduce the time it takes to locate and manage classes.</b>
			</p>
			
			<h1>GWT</h1>
			
			<p>GWT is another tool that has advanced javascript bundling capabilities. While
				GWT is packed full of great tools, none of them seem to be easily separable from the core and
				you need to lock yourself in to GWT's IDE tools, build tools and config completely to use it,
				which does not appeal to a great deal of developers.
			</p>
			
			<p>JS-Class-Loader aims to be a simple tool to do one task well, while integrating with any and 
				all IDEs and development processes.
