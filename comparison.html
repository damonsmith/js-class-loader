			<p>RequireJS is a popular tool for doing this sort of thing. This project addresses the same problem as
				RequireJS but in a different way. That problem is described very nicely
				<a href="http://www.requirejs.org/docs/why.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>This project has a very different approach to RequireJS. JS-Class-Loader forces you to use a set, well
				understood file/class/namespace structure, which means it does not need to understand javascript or read JS 
				config blocks, which means it doesn't need to run a js interpreter with all of the complexity,
				overhead and extreme lack of performance that that entails.
			</p>
			
			<p>RequireJS and similar tools go to great lengths to make it easy to
				include libraries that are a simple 5 minute process to include (e.g: JQuery) yet make it
				costly and painful to organise your own code into lots of neatly separated classes and namespaces.
				Every dependency must be listed and managed by hand, and no IDEs will take care of this for you
				as they would with Java. And probably never will until an IDE comes along that is written in Javascript
				itself.
			</p>
			
			<p>GWT is another tool that has advanced javascript bundling capabilities. While
				GWT is packed full of great tools, none of them seem to be easily separable from the core and
				you need to lock yourself in to GWT's IDE tools, build tools and config completely to use it,
				which does not appeal to a great deal of developers.
			</p>
			
			<p>So this tool is aimed primarily at javascript developers working in the Java application
				environment, because they already have Java installed, know how to execute Jar files and 
				will be familiar with properties files, servlets and project structure conventions. However, it has been
				packaged and documented in a way that will hopefully make it useful to non Java developers too.
