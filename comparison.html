			<h1>RequireJS</h1>
			<p>RequireJS is a popular tool for doing this sort of thing. This project addresses the same problem as
				RequireJS but in a different way. That problem is described very nicely
				<a href="http://www.requirejs.org/docs/why.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>This project has a very different approach to RequireJS. JS-Class-Loader forces you to use a set, well
				understood file/class/namespace structure, which means it does not need to understand javascript or read JS 
				config blocks, which means it doesn't need to run a js interpreter with all of the complexity,
				overhead and extreme lack of performance that that entails.
			</p>
			
			<p>RequireJS and similar tools go to great lengths to make it easy to
				include libraries that are a simple 5 minute process to include (e.g: JQuery) yet make it
				costly and painful to organise your own code into lots of neatly separated classes and namespaces.
				Every dependency must be listed and managed by hand, and no IDEs will take care of this for you
				as they would with Java. And probably never will until an IDE comes along that is written in Javascript
				itself.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Solving the wrong problem</h1>
			
			<p>Most of the tools out there to manage javascript try to solve the problem of installing pre-bundled
				3rd party libraries into a web app. Few if any of them make it simple to build a large codebase of object
				oriented code. However, managing a large codebase in javascript takes a million times more work than
				installing some libraries. Here's how the situation generally works for large javascript development teams:</p>

				<div class="pure-u-1-2"><img src="images/dev-comparison.svg" /></div>
				<div class="pure-u-1-2"><img src="images/dev-comparison-key.svg" /></div>
			</div>
			
			<p><b>A javascript developer does not need a suite of massively complex tooling to help with the trivial 
				task of downloading and installing a 3rd party js library. Developers need a tools that help
				manage complexity in their own codebase and reduce the time it takes to locate and manage classes.</b>
			</p>
			
			<h1>GWT</h1>
			
			<p>GWT is another tool that has advanced javascript bundling capabilities. While
				GWT is packed full of great tools, none of them seem to be easily separable from the core and
				you need to lock yourself in to GWT's IDE tools, build tools and config completely to use it,
				which does not appeal to a great deal of developers.
			</p>
			
			<p>JS-Class-Loader aims to be a simple tool to do one task well, while integrating with any and 
				all IDEs and development processes.
