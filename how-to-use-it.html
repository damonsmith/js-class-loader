			<p>The simplest way to try out the tool is to download the
				jar file and run it on the command line, telling it where your source tree is. Like this:
			</p>
			
			<code>java -jar js-class-loader.jar --sourcePaths=path/to/my/source/tree</code>
			
			<p>This will bundle all js files in your source trees. Then there are various ways to use it in a
				development project. One or more of these:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>In the build</b><br>
				Run it from Maven, Ant, Gradle or anything else. See the examples, docs and tutorials.
				</li>
				<li><b>In the IDE</b><br>
				Setup Eclipse, IntelliJ and various other IDEs to run the bundler as part of the build. See the 
				docs and video tutorials for ways to do this.
				</li>
				<li><b>At run time</b><br />
				JS-Class-Loader can also run as a servlet in java web apps.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1>Tutorial videos</h1>
			<p>
			There are loads of ways you could integrate JS-Class-Loader into your project. Here are some run-throughs
			of the simplest methods. You should watch them fullscreen at highest quality to see the text, and the
			captions have been set properly too if you don't want sound.

			<p>
				This video runs through setting up JS-Class-Loader as a builder, which then generates bundles
				and script-tag lists every time you build (which can be every time you save a file).
