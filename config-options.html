			<h1>How to configure</h1>
			
			<p>The best way to set up JSCL is to put all your config options into a properties file, then you can use that file
				from the command line, maven, servlets, IDE, or any other method. Download a copy of the base <a href="https://github.com/damonsmith/js-class-loader/blob/master/js-class-loader/src/main/resources/js-class-loader-default.properties">js-class-loader.properties</a> file
				and have a look at the comments in there for more info too.</p>
			
			<p>These options are also all available on the command line, use <pre>java -jar js-class-loader-1.x.x.jar --help</pre> to see the options.</p>
			
			<h1>Description of options</h1>

			<ul>
				<li><b>basePath</b>
					<p>
						This is the directory that the bundle file path and other paths will be relative to.
						It defaults to the current working directory.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>sourcePaths</b>
					<p>
						This is a list of paths or wildcards that tells JS-Class-Loader the locations of
						each of your source trees. For the simplest project this might just be a single folder,
						and for the most complex it might be a set of modules each with it's own source tree
						and then other locations for third party libraries. Here are some examples:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b><code>sourcePaths=js</code></b> - a single source tree based in the folder called js</li>
						<li><b><code>sourcePaths=js/src/*,js/lib</code></b> - each folder in <code>js/src</code> is the base of a
						a source tree and <code>js/lib</code> is also a source tree.
						</li>
						<li><b><code>sourcePaths=js/lib,js/modules/*/src,addons/*</code></b> each folder in modules
						has a <code>src</code> folder which is the base of a source tree, <code>js/lib</code>
						is the base of a source tree and each folder in <code>addons</code> is a source tree.
						</li>
					</ul>
						The list is comma separated and each entry can have wildcards. 
				</li>
				
				<li><b>bundleFile</b>
					<p>
						File to write the bundle to, if this isn't set then print to stdout.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>sourceMapFile</b>
					<p>
						File to write the source map to.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>allClasses</b>
					<p>
						Set this to true to parse and bundle all javascript files in your source trees. The classes
						will still be in dependency order.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>seedClasses</b>
					<p>
						Tells JS-Class-Loader where to start scanning from. These classes will always be included
						along with their dependency tree. This should be a comma separated list of the class or classes 
						that are the entry point of the application, in namespace format, such as 
						<code>com.example.myapp.MyApplication,com.examle.myapp.AlternateApp</code>. 
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>seedFiles</b>
					<p>
						Some apps define which javascript classes to run in XML or other config file formats,
						this config option tells JS-Class-Loader to parse those files for classnames and
						use those classes to start the dependency trees. You can use this alongside seedClasses,
						seedClasses can define classes that must always be loaded and this option can then add
						any dynamic classes that are defined in config.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>list</b>
					<p>
						(command line only) list the classes that would appear in the bundle
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>config</b>
					<p>
						Set the path of a config properties file to use. This can be used from the command line too.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>scriptTagsFile</b>
					<p>
						This option tells JS-Class-Loader to also generate an html snippet with script tag entries for
						each class in the bundle. The script tags file can then be included in a site in development
						mode to allow the developer to see source at the correct line.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>graphFile</b>
					<p>
						JS-Class-Loader can generate a GraphViz format DOT file of all classes and their dependencies.
						It is usually a bit too busy to be really useful but future work on groupings and visualisers
						may make this more useful for large projects.
					</p>
				</li>
